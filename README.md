# webcomponents-talk

A presentation about web components, written using web components.

This presentation is aimed to give a very high-level overview of web components. It will not answer all your questions, but it will hopefully give you what you need to get started.

The presentation is written as an HTML file that uses web components / custom elements. The code examples on the slides will show you source code of the presentation itself.

To start the presentation, run...

    npm run server

...and then connect your browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Only really tested in Chrome so far.
